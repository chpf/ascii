# ascii
Prints ASCII table to stdout.

ascii isnt on windows and I sometimes just want to reference an ascii table without google.
Incidentally, this is the first zig program I've ever written to do something useful while being 4 lines shorter than the official hello world example.

# building
zig version 0.10.0

`zig build run`


Change your `PATH` to include `zig-out/bin/ascii` or copy the binary somewhere else.
